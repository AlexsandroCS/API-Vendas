<h3>Creating Sales RESTFUL API</h3>
<p>OBS: First, I already apologize for the difference in languages ​​in which the code was presented, sometimes in English and Portuguese.<br>
  This repository was created by me to put my learning into practice, so I used my main language, which is Portuguese.</p>
<p>This repository was created to train my knowledge with spring boot and other tools that were used inside the code.</p>
<p>This code is subject to constant changes, for improvement, and sometimes the other way around too.</p>
